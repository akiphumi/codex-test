# codex-test

This is a minimal sample project demonstrating a simple `add` function and
command line interface.

## Usage

Run the script with two integers to print their sum:

```bash
python main.py 1 2
```

If either argument is omitted or passed as `None`, it is treated as `0`.

## Development

Install development requirements and run tests with `pytest`:

```bash
pip install pytest
pytest
```
